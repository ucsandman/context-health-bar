Icon Placeholders Needed
========================

For the extension to load properly, you need three PNG icon files:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These are used by Chrome for:
- Toolbar icon (16px)
- Extension management page (48px)
- Chrome Web Store listing (128px)

Temporary Solution:
-------------------
You can create simple solid color squares as placeholders:

1. Use any image editor (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Create three PNG files with the sizes above
3. Use a simple health bar icon design or solid color
4. Save them in this icons/ folder

Free Icon Resources:
-------------------
- icons8.com
- flaticon.com
- iconfinder.com

Search for: "health bar", "game health", "heart icon"

Once you have the icons, delete this file and the extension will work!
