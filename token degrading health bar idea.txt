Good instinct. The video game health bar metaphor is actually powerful because it maps perfectly to how users already feel when an LLM starts acting dumb. You just need to make it technically feasible and psychologically honest.

I will walk you through how to build this as a browser extension for ChatGPT and Claude and what the first real version should do.

First reality check
You cannot read true internal token usage or attention weights from ChatGPT or Claude UIs. That is fine. You do not need ground truth. You need a believable proxy that correlates with failure. Health bars in games are also abstractions.

So this is a client side heuristic system layered on top of the prompt composer.

Architecture overview
Browser extension only. Chrome first.
Content script injected into chat.openai.com and claude.ai
No backend needed for v1. Everything local.

You will
read the visible conversation DOM
estimate tokens
track instruction distance
compute a degradation score
render a floating HUD health bar

Core components

1 Token estimator
Use a lightweight tokenizer approximation. Do not try to perfectly match OpenAI or Anthropic. Use a character to token heuristic.

Rough rule that works
English text tokens ≈ characters divided by 4

This is good enough for trend detection which is what you care about.

Parse
system messages if visible
user messages
assistant messages
current draft input

2 Instruction detection
You need to identify what counts as core instructions.

Heuristics that work surprisingly well
Sentences containing verbs like act as, you are, follow these rules, do not, always, never
Bullet lists near the beginning of the conversation
Messages with high imperative density
Messages the user manually pins using your UI

Let users override detection because power users will want control.

3 Distance from recency
This is the heart of the health bar.

Compute
Total estimated tokens
Token position of last core instruction
Token position of last constraint

Distance ratio = instruction distance from end divided by total tokens

As that ratio increases the health bar drops.

4 Noise accumulation
Add penalties for
long assistant monologues
repeated topic drift
large unstructured data dumps
multiple conflicting instruction blocks

You do not need to be perfect. You need to be directionally correct.

Health calculation example
Start at 100
Subtract based on instruction distance
Subtract based on total tokens
Subtract based on noise signals
Clamp to zero

Map ranges
80 to 100 Green Stable
50 to 79 Yellow Degrading
20 to 49 Red Unreliable
Below 20 Skull icon basically dead

Now the fun part
Visualization

Floating HUD element anchored near the input box
Retro game style health bar
Green to yellow to red gradient
Small shake animation when dropping tiers
Optional pixel font because yes it is funny and memorable

Tooltip on hover
Why health is dropping
Primary instruction too far back
Context length high
Recent responses dominating attention

This teaches users without lectures.

Interactivity that adds real value
Pin button next to any message
Pinned messages are treated as moved to the end for scoring
Show ghost preview of what would happen if you sent the message now
Health bar animates before send

Advanced but still v1 feasible
Auto repair button when health is low
Clicking it inserts a summarized instruction restatement into the prompt
Example
“Before continuing remember the core rules are…”

This alone will make users feel like wizards.

Claude vs ChatGPT specifics
ChatGPT DOM is more stable and easier to parse
Claude uses longer assistant outputs so noise penalty matters more
Claude users will benefit more from instruction pinning because Claude is verbose

Ethical and UX note
Do not claim accuracy
Do not say this is how the model actually works
Frame it as a reliability meter
Like signal strength not battery percentage

Why this will spread
It is visual
It confirms a feeling users already have
It is funny but useful
It makes people feel smarter without being technical

If you want next steps I can
write a concrete MVP spec
sketch the scoring formula
outline the Chrome extension file structure
or help you decide whether to start with ChatGPT or Claude first

This is a good idea. It is not a gimmick. It is a behavior changing abstraction.
